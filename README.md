# Spam SMS Classification using NLP

This project implements an SMS spam classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization to convert messages into features and uses a Random Forest classifier to detect spam.

## 🚀 Live Demo
🔗 Try the deployed Streamlit app here: https://thesmsspamcheck.streamlit.app/

Features:

* Check a single SMS message

* Upload a CSV of messages for batch analysis

* Download the results as a CSV

## 🧠 Model
Vectorization: TF-IDF

Classifier: Random Forest

Note: Word2Vec + AvgWord2Vec code is present but currently not used in the final pipeline.

## ⚙️ FastAPI
The api_service.py provides a REST API interface but is not used in the Streamlit deployment or locally.
